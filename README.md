- 👋 Hi, I’m @louisianadigital
- 👀 I’m in the process of building a wordpress/WooCommerce site. The site is all but built. I am at the point of adding four levels of subscriptions. Each subsciption will have multiple digital products to subscribe to. My problem is that I do not understand how to set up the subscriptions to accomidate multiple products over multiple subscription levels. Help a brother out if you can.
